## 🗳️ Consensus/Dispute Module: OptimisticDemocracy

### Overview

The OptimisticDemocracy contract enables robust dispute resolution and consensus for rental agreements. It supports:

- Dispute raising by any party
- Voting by designated signatories
- Optimistic finalization if no dispute is raised
- Appeals with DAO voting and final decision logic
- Events for frontend notifications and integration

### Key Features

- **Dispute Lifecycle**: Raised → Voting → Resolved → Appealed → Finalized
- **Multi-party Voting**: 3 signatories per party, 4-of-6 multisig logic
- **Appeal Mechanism**: Any party can appeal with a fee, triggering DAO vote
- **DAO Voting**: 7-day window for DAO signatories to vote on appeals
- **Finalization**: Deposit returned based on outcome; events emitted for frontend

### Smart Contract Location

- `contracts/OptimisticDemocracy.sol`

### Test Coverage

- Foundry tests in `test/OptimisticDemocracy.t.sol` cover:
  - Dispute raising
  - Voting and finalization
  - Appeal and DAO voting
  - Edge cases and state transitions

### Integration Points

- Can be linked to multisig escrow for dispute handling
- Emits events for frontend notification and workflow automation

### Usage Example

```solidity
// Raise a dispute
uint256 disputeId = optimisticDemocracy.raiseDispute("Deposit not returned");
// Cast votes
optimisticDemocracy.vote(disputeId, true);
// Finalize after challenge period
optimisticDemocracy.finalize(disputeId);
// Appeal and DAO voting
optimisticDemocracy.appeal{value: 0.01 ether}(disputeId);
optimisticDemocracy.daoVote(disputeId, true);
optimisticDemocracy.finalizeDAO(disputeId);
```

## 🔐 Multisig Setup & Inventory NFT Feature

### Overview

The MultisigRentEscrow contract now supports:

- Separate setup of 3 renter and 3 landlord signatories (4-of-6 multisig)
- Minting ERC-721 NFTs to both parties, representing property inventory
- Confirmation of multisig setup and event-driven notifications

### Key Features

- **Multisig Logic**: 4-of-6 signatures required for deposit release
- **Inventory NFT**: Minted to both renter and landlord, metadata stored on-chain
- **Event Emission**: Setup, confirmation, and NFT minting events for frontend integration

### Smart Contract Location

- `contracts/MultisigRentEscrow.sol`

### Test Coverage

- Foundry tests in `test/MultisigRentEscrow.t.sol` cover:
  - Multisig setup and signatory assignment
  - NFT minting and metadata
  - Multisig confirmation and deposit release

### Usage Example

```solidity
// Setup multisig escrow and mint inventory NFT
uint256 escrowId = multisigEscrow.createEscrow{value: 1 ether}(
    landlord,
    renterSignatories,
    landlordSignatories,
    4,
    "ipfs://property-inventory-123"
);
// Confirm multisig
multisigEscrow.confirmMultisig(escrowId);
// Sign release by 4 signatories
multisigEscrow.signRelease(escrowId);
```

## ⚡ Gas Optimization Improvements

### Overview

All critical contracts have been optimized for gas efficiency:

- **Custom errors** replace string-based require checks for lower deployment and runtime costs.
- **Efficient loops** and access patterns minimize unnecessary storage reads/writes.
- **Redundant checks** removed for leaner execution.

### Optimized Contracts

- `contracts/OptimisticDemocracy.sol`
- `contracts/MultisigRentEscrow.sol`

### Test Coverage

- All Foundry tests pass after optimization, confirming no logic was broken.

### Example (Custom Error Usage)

```solidity
if (!isVoter) revert NotVoter();
if (msg.value == 0) revert DepositRequired();
```

### Why It Matters

- Lower transaction costs for users
- More scalable and performant Dapp
- Demonstrates advanced Solidity skills for job applications
